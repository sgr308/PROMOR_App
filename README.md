PROMOR App is an interactive web application to analyze and visualize label-free quantification (LFQ) proteomics data preprocessed using MaxQuant software.

PROMOR App also provides an option to build predictive models based on machine learning-based modeling.

PROMOR (PROtein MOdeling using R programming language) App is based on promor R package (https://caranathunge.github.io/promor/).

Users can use all options and parameters described in promor R package and do analysis using PROMOR App.

# PROMOR App Manual

PROMOR App is developed to perform differential expression analysis of label-free quantification (LFQ) proteomics data and build predictive models based on machine learning-based modeling with top protein candidates.

PROMOR App provides a range of quality control and visualization tools at the protein level to analyze label-free proteomics data.

PROMOR App requires two Input files: one is proteinGroups.txt file produced by MaxQuant and second is an expDesign.txt which contains the experimental design of your proteomics data.

# Input Data
proteinGroups.txt: This is one of the output files generated by MaxQuant program. It is a tab-delimited file that contains information on identified proteins from your peptide data.

expDesign.txt: This is a tab-delimited text file that contains the design of your experiment. Note that you will have to create and provide this file when you run PROMOR App with your own data.
